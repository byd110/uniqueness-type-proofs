# uniqueness-type-proofs
This is the formalization of an uniqueness type system in a Java-like imperitive language. It's layered in two fold. 
- The `Proof` holds the proof over a language without subtyping feature.
- The `Proof_subtype` holds the proof over a language with subtyping/subclassing relation.
